    "I am writing to apply for Upturn's 2019 Summer Fellowship. I heard about the opportunity from Hilary Ross, who was asked by Miranda Bogen to encourage those connected to Harvard's Berkman Klein Center for Internet & Society to apply. The fellowship particularly appeals to me because, as someone who has a deep technical understanding of machine learning, I have an obligation to ensure that AI lessens rather than widens social inequality. For this reason, Upturn's mission to \"promote equity and justice in the design, governance, and use of digital technology\" strongly resonates with me."

    "My education has been shaped by a fascination in the interplay between ethical and technical questions. While I am currently based at Harvard's School of Engineering and Applied Science completing a M.Sc. in Data Science, I have sought out opportunities to learn about the ethics and governance of AI across the Harvard schools - interdisciplinary problems demand an interdisciplinary education. A highlight of my first semester at Harvard has been participating in the Berkman Klein Center's Techtopia student cohort on digital ethics, where we received explicit training on how to work across academic and socioeconomic groups. Similarly, during my B.Sc. from Dalhousie University, I  gained a foundation in mathematics and computer science, but also wrestled with some of the critical ethical, political, and literary debates of the 20th and 21st centuries throughout my minor in Contemporary Studies. The Upturn Summer Fellowship would allow me to both apply what I've learned from these many academic communities and help me futher develop my interdisciplinary research skills."
