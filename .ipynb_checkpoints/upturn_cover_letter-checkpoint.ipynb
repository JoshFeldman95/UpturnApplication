    "Dear Ms. Dale:\n",
    "\n",
    "I am writing to apply for Upturn's 2019 Summer Fellowship. I heard about the opportunity from Hilary Ross, who was asked by Miranda Bogen to encourage those connected to Harvard's Berkman Klein Center for Internet & Society to apply. I later spoke with Ms. Bogen over the phone to learn more about Upturn’s fascinating advocacy. As someone who has a strong technical understanding of machine learning, I feel an obligation to ensure that algorithmic decision-making lessens rather than widens social inequality, which is why Upturn's mission deeply resonates with me.\n",
    "\n",
    "I am well-suited for this position because I have experience working across the many subjects involved in digital policy – interdisciplinary problems demand an interdisciplinary education. While I am currently based at Harvard's Engineering School completing a M.Sc. in Data Science, I have sought out opportunities to learn about the ethics and governance of AI across the Harvard institutions (see map below). Similarly, during my B.Sc. at Dalhousie University, I gained a foundation in mathematics and computer science, but also studied modern ethical, political, and literary debates through my minor in Contemporary Studies. The Upturn Summer Fellowship would allow me to both apply what I've learned from these many academic subjects and help me further develop my interdisciplinary research skills."

    "In addition to reaching across academic disciplines, when working on issues related to equity, I believe affected communities need to be involved and I seek out these partnerships. When I helped facilitate a summer reading camp for Indigenous children in northern Canada, I worked closely with my Inuit co-counselors to ensure that the camp was culturally relevant and that the material resonated with the students. Likewise, when I organized a homework club for new immigrants to Halifax, I would often co-teach with the older students. They had an intuitive understanding of the many social and linguistic barriers the students faced, which helped us overcome barriers unique to new immigrants in Canada. At Upturn, I would ensure to collaborate with the communities most negatively impacted by digital innovation.\n",
